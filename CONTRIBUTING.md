## Getting Started

### Fork the Repository

1. Go to the main repository: `https://github.com/Archopoia/The-Discording-Tales_Idle-Explorer`
2. Click on the **"Fork"** button at the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Clone Your Fork

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### Set Upstream Remote

Setting the upstream remote allows you to keep your fork updated with the original repository.

```bash
cd your-repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-username/your-repo.git
```

Replace `original-username` with the owner's GitHub username.
